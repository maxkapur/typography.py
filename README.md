# typography.py

Identify ASCII typography that could be better rendered as Unicode. For example,
`this right here---could be better rendered` as an em dash `â€”`.

This is *not* a spell checker or prose linter; I use it in addition to
[Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) and
[Proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint) when I want to be maximally
pedantic. Like those other tools, `typography.py` flags issues eagerly and is
prone to false positives.
